INSIDE THE ZIP FOLDER YOU WILL FIND THE FILES WITH THE MATLAB & SIMULINK
SOFTWARE PROGRAMS:
1) THE FILE NAMED "MYMAIN2" IS THE FILE WITH THE MAIN CODE IN WHICH IS DEFINED THE DESIRED
TRAJECTORY THAT WILL BE PROVIDED AS INPUT TO THE SIMULINK CONTROL SCHEME;
2) THE FILE NAMED "PLOTS" IS THE FILE THROUGH WHICH IT IS POSSIBLE TO PLOT EVERY DATA OF THE SIMULATION;
3) THE FILE NAMED "AISMC" IS THE FILE CONTAINING THE SIMULINK CONTROL SCHEME; MOREOVER, IN THIS FILE IT IS PRESENT A CALLBACK THAT DEFINES THE MASS AND THE INERTIA OF THE QUAV AND CALLS THE FILE MYMAIN2.
4) FURTHER FILES ARE PRESENT IN THE FOLDER AS "PLANNER3" THAT PROVIDES THE 7-TH ORDER POLYNOMIAL FOR THE TRAJECTORY. THESE FILES ARE MATLAB FUNCTION USED TO OBTAIN THE DESIRED TRAJECTORY AND SOLVE THE CONTROL PROBLEM.
5)IF YOU WANT TO TEST THE SAME CASES WE CONSIDERED, IN THE SIMULINK FILE YOU CAN SET UP THE DISTURBANCES AND CHOSE TO ACTIVATE OR NOT THE COMPENSATION OF THEM BY PUTTING TO 1 THE VARIABLE "OK" IN THE TOP LEFT PART OF THE SCHEME "PLANNER AND SIGNALS", IF YOU WANT TO TEST OUT THE ROBUSTNESS TO THE MASS UNCERTAINTY GO IN THE "QUADROTOR DYNAMICS" BLOCK ON THE TOP RIGHT AND UNCOMMENT LINE 2 OF "UAV DYNAMICS" BLOCK.
